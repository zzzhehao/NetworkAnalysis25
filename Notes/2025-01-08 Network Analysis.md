## Multilayer Network

- **Multiplex Network**: different types of edges
- **Multilayer Network**
	- intra- and inter-layer edges
	- Multi"layer" also in multidimensions
		- Pilosof et al: The multilayer nature of ecological network
		- Frydman et al: Practical guidelines and the EMLN R package for handling ecological multilayer networks
	- interlayer edges might mean more to contain "flow" information rather than just connecting all identical individuals/species
	- quantifying interlayer edges could be hard

## Mathematics: 

- Lasso Regression vs. Linear Regression
	- A case: linear regression can't handle unbalanced variables numbers x observation number, Lasso regression does by selecting (the important?) variables
- PGM = Probabilitic Graphic Model: Bayesian / Markov Network
- Gauss (=normal) GPM is the GPM whose random vector follows multivariate gauss distribution
- Lasso vs. ML / Neighbour selection: Lasso does not require threshold, performance after generating the graph canceled out nodes / edges by finding 0, ML or NS maintain weak relations
