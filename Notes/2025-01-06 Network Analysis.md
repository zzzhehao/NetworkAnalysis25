Network (=) Graphs

- **Nodes**, **Edges**, **Vertices**
- mode: 
	- bipartite network: edges between same type of nodes are not allowed (pollinator-plant interaction: interactions among pollinatos are not in interest)
	- unipartite if these are allowed
- Edges: directed, undirected, weighed (also negative value allowed, e.g. protein-interaction with inhibition / stimulation, unweighed, signed?
- (DAG = directed **acyclic** graph)
- Haplotype network: basically undirected, weighted unipartite network

Network structure:
- Complementarity, redundancy 
- subsets by variables => network consists multiple (multilayer?) graphs
